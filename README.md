# ReduxDemo

This app demostrates proper use of redux and react-redux. It also takes advantage of layout animation from react-native to update component.
Some important features about this app are:
1. A generic case use of redux using reducers and actions to set states and pass them through the components.
2. Layout animations occur before a component updates using LayoutAnimation.
3. Refactoring components in helper methods by passing props through mapStateToProps.
